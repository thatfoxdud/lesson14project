<p>the map buried takes place in is a old western town,
the lore takes place in 1885. one day while mining, clive
found a mysterious blue rock(element 115) which turned
him into a zombie, he was lost for 10 days before returening
to the surface and killing someone, that someone was
jebidiah browns mother, filled with grief he ventured
into the mines to find out the truth, upon finding element 115
he had a vision of "angels" (keepers) who showed him how
to build the <a href="C:\Users\Admin\Documents\SCHOOL2021\htmllessons\lesson14project\websites\Pack-A-Punch.html">Pack-A-Punch</a> machine, eventually the keepers
came back to him to have him build the agarthan device,
he could only build the vessel of it, as getting the
other parts are impossible for humans to get, eventually
the abundance of element 115 in the area drove everyone crazy,
and jebidiah, overcome with grief of his mothers death
and driven mad by element 115, he put his dead mother
into the <a href="C:\Users\Admin\Documents\SCHOOL2021\htmllessons\lesson14project\websites\Pack-A-Punch.html">Pack-A-Punch</a> machine, who turned into a ghost.
the keepers, seeing that the town was going insane, had
one last thing for jebidiah to do, he was to put the
agarthan devise vessel into the <a href="C:\Users\Admin\Documents\SCHOOL2021\htmllessons\lesson14project\websites\Pack-A-Punch.html">Pack-A-Punch</a> machine,
the mixing of power was so much that it teleported the
entire town underground in angolia, they were soon overran
by zombies.
